                       <p class="section-paragraph">Also, a patient have plenty of options  to know about a particular illness, but are very generic and might be hard to relay or trust - to enable the right knowledge, the help section of the app’s provides the customized curated information by medical professional for their episode of the problem.</p>

                       <p class="section-paragraph">The access to medical records, interaction between patient and healthcare professionals were made simple and ease to access, particularly for the chronically ill patients who needs continous monitor after they discharge from hospital or the patients who get care at their bedside. By enabling the personalized interaction, patients engage in their care and that helps them to recover faster to normal life.</p>

                       <p class="section-paragraph">The real time syncronization of patients data from the monitoring devices to the centralized system helps the healthcare professionals to pay immediate attention and provide instant care to the patient. Since the patients clicnical datas are centralized, it helps on making better alternate plan and informed decisions for the patients.</p>
