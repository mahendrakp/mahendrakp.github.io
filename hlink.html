                        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">With thousands of TV channels and seemingly unlimited choice of shows and movies, getting to the content that one is looking for is often a challenge. It enforces to juggle multiple remotes to control the home entertainment system and navigate to programming guides to select the choice.</p>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">The universal remotes do help to an extend by syncronising the IR codes, but how to take the Harmony Universal Technology to next level of transformational experience?</p>

                        <h2>The Goal</h2>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">To extend Harmony Universal Remote Technology to next level by removing the barriers between people and their entertainment by replacing confusion of multiple remotes and different program guides using single intuitive touch interface.</p>

                		<h2>One-Touch Experience</h2>	
                    	<p class="section-paragraph">Our research revealed that many iPad owners are using their iPad on the sofa while watching TV, many of them seeking ways to find out what shows are on and etc. This lead to the exploration of possibilities to introduce a simple one time step and provide a unique experience to interact, program and personalize their favorites -With just one touch - turn on all the right devices and tune to the right channel .</p>

                    	<p class="section-paragraph">The Harmony Link device and Harmony App works together to using home Wi-Fi signals and turns them into IR commands that home entertainment devices can understand. The mini IR blaster accessory was designed neatly to control the electronic deivces both inside and outside of a closed entertainment cabinet.</p>
                    	<p class="section-paragraph">The Harmony Link App transforms simple swipes and taps into useful actions, such as volume control and video playback, the user can stay in control of entertainment without taking eyes off from whatever watching on the big screen.</p>
                    	<p class="section-paragraph">Harmony Link can even connect with more than one iPad at a time, letting multiple family members use their own iPad - with their own set of favorite channels - rather than fighting over a single remote.</p>
