                        <h2>The Goal</h2>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">The product goal was to provide insights to web site merchandisers, highlight the problem areas and allow them to take appropriate actions for an impact on overall site business.</p>
                        <section class="section-space "></section>
                        <h2>MY ROLE</h2>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">End-to-End Product Designs including Design Strategy, Concept Analysis, Ideation, User Research, Wireframe Designs, Task Flows, Rapid Prototyping, Usability Testing, Interaction Design, Design Patterns, Information Architecture and UI Specifications.</p>
                        <section class="section-space "></section>
                        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
						<p class="section-paragraph">At the early stage of design process, we had a clear focus on who the target end user group will benefit with the product, ie, primarily Merchandisers and Marketers, in the retail commerce space, but I was new to it. I begin with the research to understand the end user group and later collaborated with product managers and internal marketing team to know more about the users. Later, this knowledge was helpful in the process of building the personas through the user interviews to collect particulars including what they like about the role, what problems they face, what are their responsibilities and so on.</p>
                        <section class="section-space "></section>
                        <h2>Concept designs</h2>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">The whiteboard sessions were helpful to brainstorm for possible design solutions followed by the iterations of hand drawn paper sketches were helpful to connect and build the user flows. I used balsamiq to design the wireframes which was also handy on demonstrating the functional flow as click through prototypes.</p>

                        <p class="section-paragraph">We collected early stage feedback on the design by performing the formative user testing with selective users and documented the observations with user objective comments along the process. These functional low fidelity prototypes were also useful for the engineering team to start understanding the user task flows and the evolving information architecture.</p>

                        <h2>Design Evolution</h2>  
                        <p class="section-paragraph">I collaborated with my fellow designer to scratch the visual look &amp; feel for the product and used Invision to build the functional prototypes by consolidating the designs for the respective task flows. We conducted the usability study with the users and recorded the observations. This time it was a better insight in both good and bad sense about the designs, but staying focused on the feedback from the users was important for the process and were able to collect subjective inputs on the user flows. Following to the session, we handed over a set of questionnaire forms which were aimed to collect user responses to quantify the recorded observations. </p>

                    <section class="section-wrapper ">
                            <p class="section-paragraph">The test data helped to discover that 66% of users were interested to have a dashboard widget for daily and weekly performance site wide comparison along with additional metrics combinations without switch the context. Also the data revealed that there were only 28% of users preferred to see the dashboard widgets about overall performance of the site in terms of individual products or queries. And 53% of users requested for a custom report functionality.</p>

                            <p class="section-paragraph">Overall the exercise helped to priorities the key metric that were core for the users on daily basis to monitor any sudden dips or spikes in performance and normalization of information contents as deep dive with respect to the context to enable the easy access to take necessary action.</p>

                        <h2>Visual Designs</h2>  
                        <p class="section-paragraph">I used Adobe Photoshop to design the visual designs along with the help from my fellow designer. Some of the design iterations as follows.</p>

                        <h2>Usability Findings</h2>  
                        <p class="section-paragraph">The design handover sessions to the engineers were challenging in terms of certain decisions, but with the help of the user feedback report and the rationale behind the decision it was manageable at the end to have the common understanding and buy-in about the designs.</p>

                        <p class="section-paragraph">As part of the standardisation, I defined the page templates and design specifications to make it easy for the engineers to reference and adhere to the definitions throughout the development process. The iconography was build using Adobe Illustrator which included a collection of context specific icons, image place holders, menu icons etc.</p>
