                        <h2>The Innovation Partnership</h2>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">Consumers today have access to an enormous amount of content, delivered by a range of sources and increasingly complex devices. To bring this content together through a single interface on the best screen in the house – the TV screen – Logitech worked with Google to create the best Google TV experience for the households with an HDMI-ready TV. Logitech Revue made it easy for people to use just one controller to find and enjoy content from a variety of sources – programs from TV providers, the entire Web experience, multimedia and variety of consumer apps.</p>

                        <h2>The Goal</h2>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">The primary goal of the app was to enable the consumers to experience quality digital multimedia content along with news, sports and web browsing experience.</p>

                        <h2>The big meeting</h2>
                            <p class="section-paragraph">The first meeting kicked off with senior management, we received deadline with launch date of the product, Logitech Revue, highlighting that the TV app has to be working flawless and should be ready for the beta testing program which includes both device and software.</p>
                            <p class="section-paragraph">Since, we had a tight deadline and there were inter dependencies with cross functional teams on both hardware and software, we started preparing the plan from backward -- So that the timeline between the hardware/software integration, internal unit testing, user testing dates are firm and clear across the teams.</p>
                        <section class="section-space "></section>
                        <section class="section-space "></section>
                        <h2>Getting started</h2>
                            <p class="section-paragraph">We were very excited about the project, as it was going to be a first of a kind of digital experience using an app to stream multimedia content from personal libraries on to Television! Though, initially I was bit skeptical and nervous about the timeline of the project mainly on the UX deliverables to engineers and their timelines to delivery to the hardware team for integration, etc, but somehow I had the gut feeling that this is possible.</p>
                            <p class="section-paragraph">We had a day long session on discussing variety of areas about the project including, tight deadlines, coordination with cross functional teams which were located across different zones, and possible bottleneck situations. This was important because it was not just about the app, but any slippage of time in the process could potentially affect the product launch date and the reputation of both Logitech and Google.</p>

                        <h2>Collaboration</h2>
                            <p class="section-paragraph">The offshore centralized user research team were part of the Revue product at broad level to assist both hardware and software teams on the research specific tasks including ethnography study, user interviews and conducting tests, throughout the design phase collaborating with respective teams. The personas were prepared by the team as part of the overall process which did saved some time at my end</p>
