                        <h2>BETTER, SAFE CARE FOR PATIENTS</h2>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">The idea was to design a modern centralized Electronic Patient Record (EPR) management system to help provide better, safer care for patients, and a more efficient and flexible working environment for hospital staff.</p>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">Lorenzo was designed to help NHS hospital trusts improve both their day-to-day operations and position themselves effectively for transformational change.</p>

                        <h2>Pain Points</h2>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">The issues caused by incomplete or incorrect patient data, and by inefficient administrative processes caused a greater risk to manage the patients clicinical documents across episodes! </p>
                        <!-- <section class="section-space "></section> -->
                            
                        <p class="section-paragraph">The management of clinical content, manipulating between the physical form and partial available on digital history were time consuming and was not efficient to expand or operable across different internal departments.</p>
                        <!-- <section class="section-space "></section> -->
                            
                        <p class="section-paragraph">The clicnical records about a patient, consent on privacy data, information sharing, restrictions and security were very difficult to manage acrosss various units within and across hopsitals.</p>
                        <section class="section-space "></section>
                        <section class="section-space "></section>
                        <h2>The Goal</h2>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">The core aim of the product was to directly address the issues, and provide seamless integrated experience with an emphasis on accuracy of clinicial contents through out the patient journey. </p>
						<p class="section-paragraph">A single integrated patient record should be available at any point of care, whatever and whenever it is required. This was complemented by clinical content which should support effective co-ordination of care across the hospital in the wider healthcare ecosystem.</p>

                        <p class="section-paragraph">An overall advance EPR solution to go beyond supporting today’s operational activities and provides a firm foundation for transforming care and delivering improved patient outcomes.</p>
                        <!-- <section class="section-space "></section> -->
						<p class="section-nda">To comply the non-disclosure agreement, have been limited with few designs to display here, awaiting response to include some more on — </br>whiteboard sessions, concept sketches, wireframes, remote usability testing, user task flows and visual designs.</p>
